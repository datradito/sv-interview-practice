      <p>
        We want to build a supermarket shopping experience. You should be able to browse a list of goods, select how many to purchase, and add them to a shopping cart component.
        The shopping cart should sum the pricing of all selected goods.
        </p>
        <p>
          The UX should include being able to select multiple quantities of an item, and the store also has availability items. That is, you cannot add to your shopping cart more items that are available.<br/>
          Tip: Consider the data structure correctly for computational and memory performance as well as a usuable API.
